# Overview of the [Pomodoro Timer](https://www.pomodoroaid.online)

## Concept

The app is based on the [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), designed to help users measure their study or work time. It divides one work cycle into multiple work sessions (called "pomodoros" or "pomos"), followed by short breaks, and concludes with a long break before the next cycle begins. This structure helps maintain high levels of focus.

`One cycle = (pomo + short break) * number of pomos + long break`

## Motivation

I initially used another app, but it didnâ€™t record the elapsed time when I paused the timer. This limitation inspired me to create my own app, adding not only this feature but also other functionalities I wanted, while learning new skills.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- React, React Router DOM, Axios, Firebase Authentication
- React Inline Style, Styled Components
- TypeScript, Rechart, idb, date-fns

### Backend

- NestJS, Express
- Firebase Admin
- MongoDB Atlas, Mongoose, @nest/mongoose

### Hosting

- Vercel for the React app
- Render.com for the API server

## Features

- Configure a cycle consisting of pomodoros and breaks, and measure each session.
- Provide visual feedback through a timeline.
- Automatic start of the next session.
- Weekly statistics available on the Statistics page.
- Create categories to distinguish sessions.
- Track statistics by category.
- Pause tracking and measure the time spent paused.
  - Display pauses in the timeline for feedback.
- Navigate freely between `/timer`, `/statistics`, and `/settings` during a session.
