# Overview of the [Pomodoro Timer](https://www.pomodoroaid.online)

## Concept

The app is based on the [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), designed to help users measure their study or work time. It divides one work cycle into multiple work sessions (called "pomodoros" or "pomos"), followed by short breaks, and concludes with a long break before the next cycle begins. This structure helps maintain high levels of focus.

`One cycle = (pomo + short break) * number of pomos + long break`

## Motivation

I initially used another app, but it didnâ€™t record the elapsed time when I paused the timer. This limitation inspired me to create my own app, adding not only this feature but also other functionalities I wanted, while learning new skills.
